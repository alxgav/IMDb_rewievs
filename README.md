Scraping IMDb reviews

## Task
I have a sample of around 4,000 movies, and I need to extract the first 500 IMDb reviews (the first 500 in terms of review date), along with related information for each movie.
I attach an excel file.  In the first sheet there's the list of movies and related ID.
In the second sheet I noted all the info I need, and how the dataset should be structured.
